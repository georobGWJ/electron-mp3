# electron-mp3
A standalone mp3 player built with Electron.

## Installation
This app requires that [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) be installed on your system.

Electron can be installed via Node Package Manager (npm) as documented [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron).

The electron-mp3 app requires no installation as of now (01/12/2017) but probably will in the future as it acquires dependencies. I'll keep this readme up to date.


## Run the app
This mp3 player can be started by typing either `electron .` or `npm start` whilst in the `/electron-mp3/app/` directory.

## Status
* Very basic UI skeleton begun.
* No actual functionality yet. (01/12/2017)
